### Features

This web application will call the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) when the user inputs a `City Name` and/or `Country Code` into their respective fields.

For each successful search, the application will save your search history into the browser store, which will be displayed below the search bar as a list.

From the search history, you can either search again using a previously searched city or you can delete entries from the list. There is also a button that allows you to delete the list entirely.

### Running the Application

After cloning the repository, you can run the following command from the root directory:

`npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
